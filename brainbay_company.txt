[Context of Brainbay:] Brainbay B.V. is the data and insights subsidiary of NVM Holding. Established as a separate entity on 2018-04-26 and based in Utrecht (KvK 71551034), Brainbay’s purpose is to professionalize the stewardship and enrichment of NVM’s property data for Dutch real-estate professionals across residential, commercial, and agricultural domains (Brainbay B.V., 2025). Within the NVM ecosystem, Brainbay operates the members’ exchange system (Tiara) and the MIDAS property database. Together these systems constitute the largest and most current property dataset used by Dutch estate agents and valuers, and they also supply listings to Funda and other portals (Brainbay B.V., 2025). Beyond data custody, Brainbay compiles quarterly market research with national and sub-national insights, supports the Business and Agrarisch & Landelijk domains, maintains data-quality processes (including a member hotline), and delivers member-exclusive applications that combine curated datasets with analytic enrichment to support day-to-day brokerage decisions (Brainbay B.V., 2025). In 2023, NVM announced strategic synergies between Brainbay and fluX (the group’s valuation and asset-management software arm) to accelerate product development while maintaining separate identities (NVM Holding, 2023).

[Input scope:] Input materials exist to help professionals interpret listings, transactions, and market activity. They are not legal instruments; answers based on Brainbay content should preserve the original units, dates, and caveats and remain strictly descriptive (Brainbay B.V., 2025). Privacy posture within the NVM group is conservative and purpose-bound: outputs favor aggregated indicators, apply disclosure thresholds for small cells where appropriate, and avoid personal data; for specific processing operations, NVM/Brainbay act as data controller and provide a Data Protection Officer contact at [fg@nvm.nl](mailto:fg@nvm.nl) (NVM, 2022).

[Geographical context:] The default frame is the Netherlands, referenced to Statistics Netherlands (CBS) area hierarchies and base registers. Municipalities (gemeenten) are subdivided into districts (wijken) and neighbourhoods (buurten); a neighbourhood is the lowest standardized statistical level and is defined locally by municipalities under national coordination (CBS, 2024; CBS, n.d.). For supra-municipal reporting, Brainbay aligns to CBS COROP regions (approximately NUTS-3), while provinces correspond to NUTS-2 and landsdelen to NUTS-1 (Eurostat, 2024; CBS, n.d.). Spatial boundaries and codes are taken from CBS Gebiedsindelingen and the PDOK-hosted “Wijk- en Buurtkaart,” which are time-versioned; analyses match the correct reference year to avoid artificial jumps (CBS, n.d.; PDOK, n.d.). Postcodes are supported for audience familiarity at the 4-digit and 6-digit levels, but CBS administrative geography (gemeente/wijk/buurt) remains the primary statistical frame (CBS, n.d.). The coordinate reference system for Dutch mapping is Amersfoort / RD New (Rijksdriehoeksstelsel, EPSG:28992); Brainbay uses EPSG:28992 for storage and analysis and translates to WGS84 only for web display (OGC/EPSG, 2020). Boundary changes are tracked annually: CBS publishes the official municipal configuration as of 1 January each year and correspondence tables for rolling up to supra-municipal regions; Brainbay’s time series use year-specific geography to ensure consistency across mergers and redivisions (CBS, 2025; Data.overheid.nl, 2025). Where relevant, Brainbay annotates neighbourhood-level metrics with CBS “degree of urbanisation” classes (stedelijkheid) based on surrounding address density to improve comparability across built-form contexts (CBS, n.d.).

[Glossary:] Days on Market is the number of days between listing go-live and the date a sale contract is agreed; it is used as a tempo signal alongside first-offer windows (Brainbay B.V., 2025). Absorption rate is accepted offers relative to active inventory within a defined period; it indicates how quickly supply is being taken up (Brainbay B.V., 2025). List-to-sale ratio compares the final transaction price to the original list price and summarizes negotiation tightness over a period (Brainbay B.V., 2025). The National Mortgage Guarantee (NHG) is a Dutch scheme with eligibility thresholds and fees designed to reduce mortgage risk for borrowers and lenders (NHG, n.d.). An energy label is the officially registered EP-Online rating for a dwelling or building; Brainbay uses label distributions in aggregate (RVO/EP-Online, 2025).
