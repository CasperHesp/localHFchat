• Within 15 minutes by public transport (PT: train, metro, tram, bus) of a main station, prices run 5–9% above the municipal average; typical time on market is 2–4 weeks.
• At 15–30 minutes, the premium is 2–4% with 3–5 weeks on market; at 45–60 minutes the discount is 5–10% with 5–8 weeks on market.
• Inner Randstad holds 30–40% of households, prices 20–40% above national, and 30–50% of locations above 55 dB on the Lden noise scale.
• Energy labels A/B add 3–6% in outer rings and 1–3% in inner cores versus label C; labels E–G sell 4–9% below C.
• Motorway ramp within 3 km adds 1–2% in suburbs with infrequent PT; negligible in inner cores.

RESULTS

National snapshot and access tiers
High access (≥12 peak departures/hour and ≤20 PT minutes to a main station) earns a 5–9% premium. Medium access (6–11 departures/hour or 20–35 minutes) earns 0–4%. Low access (≤5 departures/hour and >35 minutes) faces a 3–8% discount unless strong road access or standout green/water adjacency compensates.

Place-based segmentation (condensed)
Randstad inner rail ring (15–30 PT minutes to main stations)
• 30–40% of households; prices 120–140 vs national; A/B labels 20–30%; noise >55 dB in 30–50% of areas.
• Travel-time premium: ≤15 minutes +5–9%; 15–30 minutes +2–4%.

Outer Randstad and polycentric corridors (Leiden–Delft–Zoetermeer, Haarlem, Almere, Hoorn/Zaandam, Gouda)
• 20–25% of households; prices 105–120; A/B 30–45%; noise >55 dB in 20–35%.
• 30–45 minutes to main stations ranges −1 to +2%; motorway <3 km adds +1–2% where PT is sparse.

Brainport Eindhoven and satellites (Veldhoven, Nuenen, Best, Helmond)
• 3–5% of households in 45-minute catchment; prices 100–120; A/B 35–50%.

• 8–12% of households; prices 95–110; A/B 25–40%.
• 15–25 PT minutes adds +2–3%; low noise and green edges add +1–2%.

Northern knowledge cities and Drenthe belt (Groningen, Leeuwarden; Assen, Emmen)
• 5–8% of households; prices 75–95; A/B 25–35%.
• University adjacency within a 10–15-minute cycle adds +3–6%.

New-town and polder arc (Almere–Lelystad–Zeewolde; parts of Haarlemmermeer)
• 4–6% of households; prices 90–105; A/B 45–60%.
• 25–45 minutes to Amsterdam hubs; motorway <2 km adds +2–3%.

Travel-time pricing gradient
Every 10 PT minutes closer within the first 30 minutes adds ~1.5–2.5% to achievable price; beyond 30 minutes the effect tapers to ~0.5–1.0% per 10 minutes. Each additional four peak departures/hour adds ~0.5–1.5% up to about 16/hour, then saturates. Locations both ≤25 PT minutes and ≤10 driving minutes to a main station gain an extra 1–2% because buyers value choice.

Metro-level tactical notes (compressed)
Amsterdam urban edge (Nieuw-West, Noord, IJburg–Zeeburgereiland): 15–30 PT minutes; prices 110–125; A/B 25–35%; 35–50% of areas >55 dB near A10/flight paths with −2–6% within 200 m on lower floors. Focus on evening open houses; highlight National Mortgage Guarantee in the €430k–€470k band.

Almere arc (Stad/Poort/Buiten, Oosterwold): 25–40 PT minutes; prices 95–105; A/B 50–60%; local surface-water risk trims ground floors 1–3%. Emphasise two-mode commuting; weekend viewings for families.

METHODS NOTE
Geography is analysed on a national hexagon grid where each cell covers about 0.7–0.8 square kilometres. Each listing and feature is assigned to a hexagon and augmented with adjacent-hex context (neighbour effects). Access is measured as peak-hour minutes by public transport to the nearest main rail station and driving minutes to the nearest motorway ramp. Lden is a day-evening-night noise level in decibels; energy labels run from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient). The National Mortgage Guarantee is a Dutch mortgage-support scheme for eligible buyers.
